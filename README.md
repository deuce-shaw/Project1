Part 1:
Employee Attrition by Job Role and Marital Status
Jennifer Hooker
	To assess employee attrition, I began by breaking down the 16.1% of employees who resigned based on their job satisfaction. Surprisingly, there was no trend in this data. On a scale of 1 – 4, former employees have an almost even distribution of responses. I expected the data to reflect mostly low scores of satisfaction since the employees left the company. The next step was to assess attrition by job role. 
	Once former employees were separated by job role, I also separated the groups by marital status. Here we can see laboratory technicians, research scientists, sales executives, and sales representatives are leaving in much larger numbers. In these categories, employees marked as single left at higher rates. Research shows single employees value company culture, community, and flexibility. It is highly likely the company is not creating an inclusive, welcoming environment for singles. Offering plus ones to company events, participating in company “game” leagues, and in-office mixers can provide more opportunities for singles to be included.  In the remaining five categories where more employees are being retained, married employees are leaving more often than single and divorced employees. This calls into question the benefits the company is offering. Married employees often make employment decisions based on family factors. Considering how few of these employees are leaving, it is imperative to review the main factor determining the exit of the most loyal employees in exit interviews.
