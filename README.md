Part 1:
Employee Attrition by Job Role and Marital Status
Jennifer Hooker
	To assess employee attrition, I began by breaking down the 16.1% of employees who resigned based on their job satisfaction. Surprisingly, there was no trend in this data. On a scale of 1 – 4, former employees have an almost even distribution of responses. I expected the data to reflect mostly low scores of satisfaction since the employees left the company. The next step was to assess attrition by job role. 
	Once former employees were separated by job role, I also separated the groups by marital status. Here we can see laboratory technicians, research scientists, sales executives, and sales representatives are leaving in much larger numbers. In these categories, employees marked as single left at higher rates. Research shows single employees value company culture, community, and flexibility. It is highly likely the company is not creating an inclusive, welcoming environment for singles. Offering plus ones to company events, participating in company “game” leagues, and in-office mixers can provide more opportunities for singles to be included.  In the remaining five categories where more employees are being retained, married employees are leaving more often than single and divorced employees. This calls into question the benefits the company is offering. Married employees often make employment decisions based on family factors. Considering how few of these employees are leaving, it is imperative to review the main factor determining the exit of the most loyal employees in exit interviews.

 Part 2:
 Attrition by Age vs tenure | Tenured Satisfaction
Brittany Butchkoski
	We looked into the age of employees at the organization due to the fact a lot of employees leave at a certain age for retirement. However, we needed to look into age and tenure to determine if one was leaving for retirement. We created a scatter plot based on age vs the years worked at the company. No matter the age lower tenured employees were the ones leaving the organization. Based on attrition turnover rates employees that we lower tenured typically are dissatisfied if there is a high turnover rate. We then assessed employee satisfaction based on tenure. We found that employees who have been with the organization 0-5 years were equally dissatisfied and satisfied. While the tenure with this organization was mainly low or high it seems less tenured people were very dissatisfied while high tenured employees were more satisfied. The tenured satisfaction backed up our findings that younger less tenured employees were unhappy and leaving the organization.  
 

Part 3 Summary Analysis: 
Kevin Shaw
	As it appears in the data the amount of employees that traveled rarely was far greater than the amount of employees that traveled frequently or not at all. Therefore, I believe that the employees were either on one end of the spectrum or the other, but not in between. By this I mean that when these employees were looking for jobs they either wanted to be on the road frequently or they wanted to stay put where they were but the employees that were mostly on the job site but had to travel for some reason seamed unhappy which pushed them out the door.
